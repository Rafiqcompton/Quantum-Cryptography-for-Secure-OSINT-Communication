Understand the principles of quantum cryptography, including Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), and its application in secure communication.
Familiarize yourself with quantum computing frameworks, such as Qiskit, and cryptographic libraries, such as cryptography, for implementation.
Generate quantum keys using a QKD protocol and ensure their secure distribution.
Implement encryption and decryption algorithms using the quantum keys to protect OSINT data during transmission.
