Quantum Cryptography for Secure OSINT Communication utilizes quantum computing principles to establish secure communication channels for transmitting sensitive open-source intelligence (OSINT) data.
Quantum cryptography algorithms, such as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), ensure unbreakable encryption, protecting against eavesdropping and unauthorized access. This has applications in intelligence agencies, corporate investigations, and any scenario where secure OSINT data communication is crucial.
