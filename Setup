To set up the quantum cryptography environment for secure OSINT communication, follow these steps:

Install the necessary quantum computing framework, such as Qiskit, and cryptographic libraries, such as cryptography.
Import the required libraries and functions into your Python environment.
Follow the guidelines to generate quantum keys using a QKD protocol.
Implement encryption and decryption algorithms using the quantum keys.
Test the encryption and decryption processes with sample OSINT data to ensure they function as expected.
