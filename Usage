To use the quantum cryptography algorithm for secure OSINT communication, follow these steps:

Generate quantum keys using the generate_quantum_keys function.
Encrypt the OSINT data using the encrypt_osint_data function and the generated quantum keys.
Transmit the encrypted data securely.
On the receiving end, decrypt the data using the decrypt_osint_data function and the shared quantum keys.
Access the decrypted OSINT data for further analysis or processing.
Please note that the code snippets provided are simplified examples and may require further implementation and customization based on specific requirements and cryptographic protocols.
